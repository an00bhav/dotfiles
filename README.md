### Current setup

Since I have been extensively using apple's MacBook Pros both at work and for personal projects, I have moved to using a combination of the following tools as my preferred method of syncing my favourite tools across multiple machines. 

- [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
- [bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
- [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
